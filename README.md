# Customer Feedback Insights Dashboard

An interactive dashboard that uses a local LLM (Flan-T5) and Gradio to provide meaningful insights from customer satisfaction data.

## Features

- Key drivers of satisfaction using correlation analysis
- Interactive pie chart of satisfaction levels
- AI-generated text insights using Flan-T5
- Fully local â€” data never leaves your machine

|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| pandas            | Data loading and manipulation          |

| torch             | Runs the model backend                 |
| python-dotenv     | Environment variables support          |

## Installation

Install all required packages:

`pip install pandas plotly gradio transformers torch python-dotenv`

(Optional) If you want GPU acceleration:

`pip install accelerate`


## Usage

1. Replace the placeholder with the correct path to your CSV file in `dashboard.py`:

`path = "your/path/here"`


2. Run the app:

`python dashboard.py`


3. Gradio will open in your browser (typically at http://127.0.0.1:7860).

## Dataset Requirements

The input CSV must include the following columns:

- ProductQuality
- ServiceQuality
- PurchaseFrequency
- SatisfactionScore
- LoyaltyLevel
- Country

Each row represents an individual customer response.

## Model Info

The dashboard uses the `google/flan-t5-base` model from Hugging Face, which performs summarization locally via the `transformers` library. It supports both CPU and GPU execution.
